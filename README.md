# outdatedbrowser.com website translation 

### The purpose of this branch is to be used solely as language repository of the files/translation for the website: [outdatedbrowser.com](http://outdatedbrowser.com)
<br><br>



## How to


1. Inside /language folder, duplicate folder /en (our default language is english)

2. Rename with a proper language abbreviation: it — italian , de — german, fr — french, nl — dutch , br — brazilian portuguese, etc. <br> NOTE: we are using a two letter  code for the language. If you have variations of the same language use URL country code, e.g.: br—brazilian portuguese; us—american english

3. Translate site_lang.php file. Please don't change anything else.


4. Send a pull request for this branch ( feature/languages-website ), and we do the rest asap.
